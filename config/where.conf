# This is the WHERE configuration file. It is read and handled by the where.config module, and further documentation
# can be found there.
#
# This file can be named either .whererc, whererc or where.conf.  WHERE will look for this file first in the current
# directory, then in the home direcory of the user, and finally in the system-wide /etc-directory.

# The path section specifies paths to the WHERE work directory, which is where all files are stored during
# calculations. Furthermore, the data path specifies where to find all input data. Most of the actual filenames are
# specified in files.conf relative to this path. Finally, the where directory is used by a few files, but will be set
# automatically by the program at runtime. Note that if you want to change these for a local computer it might be more
# effective to use a local WHERE configuration file like where_local.conf that can be kept outside the version control
# repository.

# COMMON ANALYSIS CONFIGURATION
#
# IDENTIFIER          OPTIONS             DESCRIPTION
#______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# read_from_library   <True|False>        - Read configuration from configuration library files (placed under 'config'
#                                           path), which includes all configurations marked with ':library'. See also
#                                           option 'write_to_library'.
# reference_ellipsoid <ellipsoid>         - Reference ellipsoid definition needed for generation of ellipsoidal
#                                           coordinates. Following reference ellipsoides are defined: grs80, wgs84,
#                                           wgs72.
# write_level         <level>             - Write levels are used to decide which fields of a dataset and other 
#                                           information should be written to disk. Levels can be:
#                                             operational: Write dataset fields, which are used afterwards in the
#                                                          analysis. 'operational' processing uses minial disk memory.
#                                             analysis:    Write dataset fields, which are useful in the analysis
#                                                          either to interpret results or make analyses under
#                                                          processing (e.g. data which can help to identify a clock
#                                                          break in VLBI)
#                                             detail:      Other fields, which are useful (e.g. for debugging)
#
#                                           In addition write levels are used to define, what kind of information are
#                                           written to a Where output file.
# write_to_library    <True|False>        - Write configuration library files for configuration options marked with
#                                           ':library' to 'config' path. See also option 'read_from_library'.

#     mapping_function:          gmf, gpt2, gpt2w, vmf1_gridded
#
# Depending on the chosen model following meteorological data (MET), zenith hydrostatic
# delay (ZHD), zenith wet delay models (ZWD) and gradient models (GRAD) are used:
#
#    MAP. FUNC     MET           ZHD              ZWD           GRAD
