"""Library for geodetic rotation matrices

Description:
------------

Creates rotation matrices for rotation around the axes of a right handed Cartesian coordinate system and
their derivatives.

Contains the rotation matrices (and angles) for the transition from a terrestrial reference system to a 
geocentric celestial reference system according to the IERS 2010 Conventions.
